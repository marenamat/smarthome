My own smarthome
================

These are little projects used to drive my own smarthome in a somehow minimal way.

I use these projects also to learn new things, therefore I'm probably just
inventing a wheel. I don't care anyway.

Currently, there is a WIP temperature and humidity sensor based on ESP-12 to be
put into every room of my home.
